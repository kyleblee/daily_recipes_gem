## List of things to accomplish:
  <!-- - CONNECT YOUR LOCAL REPO TO A GITHUB REPO -->
  - Make sure you are committing OFTEN! (every 3-7 minutes / less than 15 lines of code per commit)
  - Track your thoughts, stumbles, and fixes as you go so you have plenty of content for the blog post.
  - If you have any questions along the way, DON'T use the "Ask New Question" feature. Instead, reach out to your Learn Instructor for this section.
  - Create a console so that you have a sandbox to play in.
  - Short description on what the gem is for in the README.md file
  - Final instructions to the user on how to install, run, and use the gem. Use the examples
  in the lab instructions as a guide for this (in the README.md file)
  - Specify your gem's dependencies in daily_recipes.gemspec. It's also best practice to specify all the gems that our library depends on in the gemspec.
  - Use daily_recipes.rb as the environment file of your project.
  - Create a video demo (with narration!) describing how a user would interact with your working gem.
  - Write a blog post about the project and process, using the notes you took throughout development.

## A list of process and progress along the way to use on the blog post:
    - First, used "bundle gem daily_recipes" to automatically generate the project files. Then, created a remote git repository and hook it up to my local repository after making my first commit.
