# DailyRecipes

Searching for a recipe can be overwhelming. With seemingly hundreds of websites and cookbooks to look through, it can be hard to make a quick decision on what you want to make for a personal or family meal. To avoid this, people frequently make the same recipes, over and over again; sacrificing spontaneity for convenience. It's time for a solution.

Welcome to Daily Recipes! Your new, handy-dandy CLI application for receiving a short, digestible list of recipes every day. At the perfect intersection of spontaneity and laziness, Daily Recipes makes it easy to choose from a short menu of dishes (scraped from three popular recipe sites), get more information on any that pique your interest, and even be taken to the full recipe in-browser. It is simple, easy to use and saves you from having to look through numerous sites just to find a quick recipe.

Enjoy and happy cooking!
